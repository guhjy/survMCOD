Description:  Fits Cox regression models for the hazard of death due to a disease of interest based on multiple
              cause-of-death data, thus acknowledging that death may be caused by several disease processes acting 
              concurrently. This is based on the model for multiple-cause mortality proposed by Moreno-Betancur et al. 
              (2017) which extends the single-cause competing risks model to that setting.
